      "description": "The enhanced for loop, introduced in Java 5, provides a concise and efficient way to iterate over arrays and collections. Instead of using traditional for loops with index variables, you can simply iterate over the elements directly. This improves code readability and reduces the chance of off-by-one errors.",
